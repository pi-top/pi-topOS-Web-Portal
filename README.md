A Python server that hosts a web application to interact directly with a Linux machine.

In addition to the core web server, desktop management of ```pt-web-portal` app pages via [`web-renderer`](https://github.com/pi-top/web-renderer) is handled via a separate binary Debian package: `pt-web-portal-desktop`.
