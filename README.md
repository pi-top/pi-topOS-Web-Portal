# pi-topOS first time setup application.

A simple Python server hosts a web application.

This project contains a React application created using `create-react-app` and
a Flask server which is configured to serve the react application's build
folder and provide REST endpoints for the react app to interact with.

## Installation

`yarn`

## Production

### Build

There is a build script `build.sh` that builds the react application
and copies it into the Flask project in the correct place.
