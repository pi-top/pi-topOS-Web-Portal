      deemed to be severed from this Agreement; and (b) the validity and
      enforceability of all of the other provisions hereof, shall in no way be
      affected or impaired thereby. CEED Ltd’s failure to exercise, or delay in
      exercising, a right, power or remedy provided in this Agreement or by law
      shall not constitute a waiver of that right, power or remedy. CEED Ltd’s
      waiver of any obligation or breach of this Agreement shall not operate as
      a waiver of any other obligation or subsequent breach of the Agreement.
      The English language version of this Agreement shall be the official and
