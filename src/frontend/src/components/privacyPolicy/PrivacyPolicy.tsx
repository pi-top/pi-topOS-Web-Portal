      <b>5 HOW YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS COLLECTED</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      5.1 "We may collect and process data about you that comes under our control in the following manners:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>data given when you contact us or report a problem with pi-top services</li>

    </ul>
    <p>
      5.2 As far as your payment details are concerned, we will not receive or store any of your payment details. Any payment details are handled entirely by the relevant payment platform and/or payment method/processor. When you buy any pi-top product, we are notified by the payment processor once the transaction takes place and use this notification to ensure you receive your purchased items. We therefore do not receive any of your actual payment information, such as your card number, security code, or billing address. We only store data regarding transaction dates, value, currencies, and the products underlying the transaction.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>6 THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH WE USE YOUR DATA (LEGAL BASIS FOR DATA PROCESSING)</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      6.1 "When we process personal data about you, we do so only as necessary to provide you with the pi-top services you desire (i.e. to perform the agreement between us), to meet our legal obligations or to fulfil the so-called ‘legitimate interests’ of pi-top, or in accordance with the other cases described in the section ‘How is your data used?’.
    As further clarification, legitimate interests comprise any lawful purposes that could be reasonably expected to be necessary to the proper conduct of pi-top business, such as: protecting the security of the data we process, marketing pi-top products and services, ensuring our marketing is relevant to you, and conducting anti-fraud checks. When we rely on the legitimate interest as a legal basis for processing your data, we consider and balance any potential impact on you and your rights. For other purposes, we will ask for your consent. You will be entitled to withdraw this consent at any time with no impact on the validity of the processing before your consent has been withdrawn."
    </p>
    <p>
      6.2 When we transfer your data outside the European Economic Area, we do so on the basis of a variety of legal mechanisms. This is described in more detail under the ‘Trusted Partners’ section.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>7 HOW WE HANDLE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      7.1 The data collected by pi-top from you is stored on our secure servers in England or – only if necessary - by those of our Trusted Partners as described below. We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data against unauthorised or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction or damage. We will take all reasonably necessary steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <p>
      7.2 "We will retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. In certain special cases, a longer retention period might be required by law, such as for tax reasons, accounting purposes or other legal requirements and obligations. When we no longer require your personal data in order to provide our services to you, we will either delete it or anonymise it.
    we will store the data that is associated with the services you use for the duration of the agreement in order to enable you to access pi-top services (e.g., project progress on pi-topDASHBOARD or pi-topCLASSROOM). Should you close or delete your pi-top account, the limited data that we collected about you will still be retained for an additional few years for tax, legal and accounting purposes;
    in the event of you contacting us without using any pi-top service, we will retain correspondence with you for as long as it is reasonably necessary to deliver meaningful and efficient assistance to you. Following this, we will only be storing such correspondence for the shortest period necessary in the discharging of pi-top’s legal and accountability obligations;
    for marketing purposes, we will store data as long as we have your ongoing valid consent. If you choose to unsubscribe, we promise to delete or anonymise all your relevant personal data, without undue delay and no later than within 30 days from the moment we receive a request to unsubscribe."
  </p>

    <p>
      <b>8 HOW IS YOUR DATA USED?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      8.1 "Your data may be used for the following purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>To carry out our obligations arising from any agreements between you and us</li>
      <li>To communicate with the users of our services</li>
      <li>To provide you with products or services that you request from us</li>
      <li>To provide you with marketing information (including personalised and targeted marketing emails), which we consider may be of interest to you. For example, we may send you newsletters or emails about pi-top products and services (this is entirely optional and we will ask you for informed permission first)</li>
      <li>To allow you to participate in interactive features of pi-top services should you choose to do so</li>
      <li>To notify you about modifications to pi-top services</li>
      <li>To maintain, improve or modify pi-top products or services</li>
      <li>To organise contests and competitions (including contact with participants, evaluation of applications, distribution of prizes, and payment of tax on prizes)</li>
      <li>To calculate conversion rates and other performance elements of pi-top products and/or services</li>
      <li>For legal, tax, and accounting purposes</li>
      <li>For accountability purposes as defined by EU legislation (GDPR)</li>
      <li>To target and personalise our marketing communications, offers and advertisements that we display on our websites and services as well as those of third parties based on the combined data we have collected about you."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      8.2 "Whenever we personalise or target our marketing communications, offers and advertisements, we may profile your personal data. This means that we may use the data we collect to adjust the communication addressed to you in order to meet your needs and expectations regarding the performance of pi-top products and services. In such cases, we do not, however, use your personal data for profiling, which would constitute automated decision-making that could affect your legal situation. In simpler terms, we do not use algorithms to make decisions which would have an impact on your individual legal rights or affect your legal status or rights under the agreement between us. For example, we do not make automatic offers based on your behaviour on online portals such as pi-topCLASSROOM.
    If you decide that you no longer want to receive personalised offers, product recommendations from us, or any advertising news at all, you can opt out of this service at any time."
    </p>
    <p>
      8.3 We might process some aggregated and general non-personal data related to user behaviour (e.g. sales per region) with third-party partners who work with us to provide pi-top products and services to you, for example, payment providers. We are doing this in order to support, improve or amend pi-top products and services. We may also share non-personal data with data analysis services to help us better run pi-top services.
